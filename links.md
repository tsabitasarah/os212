1. [Understanding Operating Systems](https://edu.gcfglobal.org/en/computerbasics/understanding-operating-systems/1/) <br>
When learning about operating systems, it's important to start from the basic. This link explains about the definition, job, and types of operating systems.

2. [How Do Operating Systems Work?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GjNp0bBrjmU) <br>
The link is an animated video that shows the basics of operating systems visually, the duration of the video isn't too long and it's pretty interesting.

3. [What is a Virtual Machine (VM)? In 3 minutes - Virtual Machine Tutorial for Beginners](https://youtu.be/yIVXjl4SwVo) <br>
As we use virtual machine in Operating Systems (OS212) course, the link is useful to gain knowledge and know more about what a virtual machine is.

4. [40 Basic Linux Commands used Frequently](https://linoxide.com/essential-linux-basic-commands/) <br>
As a beginner, this link helps me a lot to learn and get familiar with the basic commands for Linux.

## WEEK 02
1. [C Programming | In One Video](https://youtu.be/3lQEunpmtRA) <br>
As we going to use C language for Operating Systems course, this video —  which is considerably shorter than others — helps me in learning about the language from the basic.

2. [What is Computer Security?](https://www.edureka.co/blog/what-is-computer-security/#SecurityPractices) <br>
On the second week, we learn about computer security. This brief article tells me quite a bit about computer security.

## WEEK 03
1. [File Systems in Operating System](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/file-systems-in-operating-system/) <br>
On the third week, we learn about file system interface, file system implementation, and file system internals. This link describes about the function, directory structure, and mounting of file systems.

## WEEK 04
